        Hello, my name is Brody and I am a full-stack web developer based in
        British Columbia.
      </h3>
      <p>
        My developer experience involves fullstack work using React / Typescript
        / SCSS / Node.js and, more recently, C# .NET web apps. I have worked
        with PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Azure SQL Database. I use Figma for
        designing and I primarily host projects on Azure. In my previous work in
        the insurance industry I worked with countless clients and know how to
        communicate and manage expectations.
      </p>
      {/* <p>
        My current experience involves numerous front-end projects with React,
        Typescript, and SCSS. I have also built a number of full-stack projects
        with Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. I use Figma for my design work
        and have hosted projects on Microsoft Azure. In my previous work in the
        insurance industry I worked with countless clients and know how to
        communicate and manage client expectations.
